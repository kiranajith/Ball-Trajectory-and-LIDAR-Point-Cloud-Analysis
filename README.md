## ENPM 673 Perception for autonomous Robots 
### Project 1

---
**1. Ball Trajectory Analysis**

Analyzing a video of a red ball being thrown against a wall. The trajectory of the ball is assumed to follow the equation of a parabola. The goal is to detect and plot the pixel coordinates of the center point of the ball in the video, fit a curve to the extracted coordinates using Standard Least Squares, and predict the x-coordinate of the ballâ€™s landing spot.


**2. Lidar Point Cloud Analysis**

Working with two CSV files containing noisy LIDAR point cloud data in the form of (x, y, z) coordinates of the ground plane. The goal is to compute the covariance matrix, compute the magnitude and direction of the surface normal, and fit a surface to the data using various estimation algorithms such as Standard Least Squares, Total Least Squares, and RANSAC.
